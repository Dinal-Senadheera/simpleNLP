# simpleNLP
A simple Natural language processing model created using Google Colab to do a sentiment analysis of tweets about an airline.
Here two models were created that is a Multinomial model and a Random Forest Classifier model . Both models were trained with the same data.
For anyone interested the data was taken from this link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment
